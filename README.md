## Bitwise Microlab
In this microlab, we're going to do a bunch of bitwise operations.

The tests are written already and the functions are stubbed out; write the function bodies to make the tests pass.

You should use all of the bit operations at least once.  They are:

* ~ (not)
* & (and)
* | (or)
* ^ (xor)
* << (bitshift left)
* \>> (bitshift right extending sign bit)
* \>>> (bitshift right ignoring sign bit)
